# Privacy-Preserving Learning-Augmented Data Structures
This repository contains the experimental code, data structures, benchmarks, and figures accompanying the paper:

**Privacy-Preserving Learning-Augmented Data Structures**

This repo provides:
- Source code for data structures and experiments described in the paper (except ZipZip Tree variants)
- Workload benchmarks (Zipfian, Inverse Power)

# How to obtain Biased property for any data structure
To Do...

# Setup
1. Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed
2. Install required Python packages from project root directory:
```bash
pip install numpy nltk matplotlib
```
3. Add `__init__.py` files (can be empty) to both subdirectories to mark them as packages:

```bash
tests/__init__.py
structures/__init__.py
```
This allows Python to recognize them as modules and handle imports correctly. 

4. Create the results directory structure from project root directory (required for tests to run correctly):
```bash
mkdir -p results/InversePowerTest
mkdir -p results/ROFZipfianTest
mkdir -p results/ROTZipfianTest
mkdir -p results/SizeTest
```
These directories will be ignored by Git (as specified in `.gitignore`) because the test scripts save data there. The tests will fail if these directories do not exist. 

## Running Tests
All test scripts are located in the `tests/` directory. To run a test:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory:
```bash
C:\Privacy-Preserving-LADS>
```
2. Run the desired test using the `-m` flag:
```bash
python -m tests.{fileName}
```
3. Replace `{fileName}` with the test script name without the `.py` extension.
- Example:
```bash
python -m tests.ROF_ZipfianTest
python -m tests.ROT_ZipfianTest
python -m tests.InversePowerTest
python -m tests.SizeTest
```

## Why -m is used

The `-m` flag tells Python to run the script as a module. This ensures:
- Imports like `from structures.StaticRSL import *` or `from tests.DataGenerator import *` work correctly.
- Python resolves imports relative to the project root rather than the scriptâ€™s folder.
